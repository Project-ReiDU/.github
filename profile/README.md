## Project ReiDU
ReiDU is a toolkit used for development, distribution and installation of modifications for games based on the Infinity Engine.

Inspired by [WeiDU](https://weidu.org/).

### Three Motivations
1. "I like WeiDU, but C++ is not my fav, so I'm creating ReiDU"
2. "I'm grateful for WeiDU, so I'm creating ReiDU"
3. "I wanted to redo WeiDU, so I'm creating ReiDU"

### Three Goals
1. A development tool with similar functionalities to WeiDU.
2. A translator from WeiDU language(s) to the new language(s) or DSL(s).
3. A playground/exploratory mode.

### Three Dependencies
1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) --- for the computation-heavy parts.
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/) --- as its dynamic language of choice.
3. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) --- for easy docs.
